Things to do. This is a wish list of features to add to the host layer...

Common Base Class for All Plugin Instances
  - currently using a void * to pass instance pointers to components that do not
    need to know about image effects (eg: interact base classes).
  - Should have a base 'Plugin::Instance' class that ImageEffect::Instance and any
    other kind of plugin instance should derive from.

XML Resource Support
  - have the host layer manage the external XML resource file and relabel things appropriately.

Support for Custom Params
  - not there yet
  - should have the host layer manage most of the custom param animation stuff as well.
