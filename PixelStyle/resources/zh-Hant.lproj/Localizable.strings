    <key>disk space body</key>
    <string>To allow for unlimited undos PixelStyle needs to write some data to your system disk during operation. However since your system disk now has less than 50 MB of space some or all of the data PixelStyle has written to disk will be deleted (possibly causing certain undo or redo actions to fail). As such, it is strongly advised you save all documents and quit PixelStyle. This may improve the disk space situation on your system disk however you are urged to delete some additional files from your system disk to ensure this problem does not arise again in the future.</string>
